# Computer Vision Pipeline
---

This section covers the work related to the Computer Vision pipeline. Many steps and tasks were involved in this part of the project, but I have chosen to highlight only the most important ones. For a detailed explanation of all tasks, refer to the `Final Project Report`.

Here are two examples of the pipeline's output:

### Project Breakdown

This part of the project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Plant Organ Segmentation Models**  
   Semantic segmentation models trained to segment each organ of the plant.

2. **Plant Image Analysis**  
   The computer vision pipeline used for image processing, which includes organ segmentation, landmark detection, and root measurement.

Each section has its own folder containing the code and a detailed description.
