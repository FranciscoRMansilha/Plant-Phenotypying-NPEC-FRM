# Computer Vision Pipeline
---

As part of our school project we were tasked with training models to segment 5 plant classes:

- Seed
- Root
- Shoot
- Occluded Root
- Background

---

For concision purposes I will only share the code that I used to prepare the Data for model training `Data Preparation.ipynb` and the code I used to train the Root segmentation model `Root model.ipynb`

---

I also have 2 folders with additional information about the **shoot** and **root** segmentation models which ended up being the most important for NPEC's final Computer Vision Pipeline.
