# Robotics and Reinforcement Learning
---

This section covers the work related to Robotics and Reinforcement Learning. The objective was to use the previously developed Computer Vision Pipeline to locate the primary root tip of each plant in a petri dish and simulate its inoculation.

Here is an example:

### Project Breakdown

This part of the project is divided into the following steps:

1. **Set-up OT-2 Digital Twin**  
   A virtual representation of the robotic liquid handling system used by NPEC.

2. **Use a PID Controller System**  
   Simulate inoculation using a PID controller alongside the computer vision pipeline.

3. **Train a Reinforcement Learning Model**  
   Simulate inoculation using a reinforcement learning model with the computer vision pipeline.

4. **Compare Performance**  
   Evaluate the differences between the PID controller and reinforcement learning approaches.

For each step, a folder is provided containing the code and a detailed description.
