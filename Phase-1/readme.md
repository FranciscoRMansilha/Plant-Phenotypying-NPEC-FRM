# NPEC Plant Phenotyping - Phase 1
---

This folder contains information about a project developed during my university studies, in collaboration with the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC).

NPEC presented us with a challenging task: segmenting plant roots from images and precisely controlling a liquid handling robot to inoculate plants. This project aims to enhance plant phenotyping by integrating advanced computer vision and robotics solutions.

The project can be broken down into two main phases:

1. **The Computer Vision Pipeline**  
   A pipeline for analyzing and segmenting plant roots from images, incorporating both traditional and AI-based techniques.

2. **The Robotics Simulation**  
   A simulation of the plant inoculation process using a PID controller and a reinforcement learning-based controller to compare their performance in achieving precise inoculation.

This project was part of my second-year curriculum, and after achieving excellent results, I, along with four other students, continued working closely with NPEC to refine, enhance, and deploy the solution at their Utrecht facilities. This repository focuses on **Phase 1**, and I will soon be able to share more about **Phase 2**.
