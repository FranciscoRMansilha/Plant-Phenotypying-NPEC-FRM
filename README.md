This repository presents a project developed for the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC), aimed at innovating plant science through the integration of computer vision, reinforcement learning, and robotics. The project focuses on segmenting plant roots from images and automating inoculation processes, which are essential for advancing our understanding of plant phenotypes and automating other-wise time consuming tasks for Plant Scientists

This project was part of a second-year curriculum at Breda University of Applied Sciences, where all students worked on similar plant phenotyping challenges. However, I and four other students were selected for having the best projects, and we've continued to work closely with NPEC up until now. Our ongoing collaboration involves improving the solution, adding new features, and preparing it for deployment at NPEC's facilities in Utrecht.

This repository is divided into **Phase 1**, detailing the initial project in which all students participated, and soon I will be able to reveal information about **Phase 2**.
